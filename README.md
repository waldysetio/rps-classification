# Rock Paper Scissors Classification

This program can predict the shape of either rock, paper, or scissors in a rock-paper-scissors hand game. The dataset was obtained from https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip. The ML model in this repository is still biased due to the fact that it is trained on images with green background. The accuracy is above 99% and the validation accuracy is above 98% in predicting unseen images with green background but still so lame to predict images whose background color is not green. Changes will be added to improve the program and accomodate images whose backgrounds are not green.
