# Rock Paper Scissors Classification

This program can predict the shape of either rock, paper, or scissors in a rock-paper-scissors hand game. The dataset was obtained from https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip. This program works best when the background of the image is green. The accuracy of the prediction is above 99% and the validation accuracy is above 98%. Changes will be added to improve the program and accomodate images whose backgrounds are not green.
