# Rock Paper Scissors Classification

This program can predict whether a hand image is forming rock, paper, or scissors. The dataset was obtained from https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip. This program works best when the background of the image is green. The accuracy of the prediction is more than 99% and the validation accuracy is more than 98%. Changes will be added to improve the program and accomodate images whose backgrounds are not green.
